This document describes the data used for this project, transformations that the **run_analysis.R** script performs 
to clean up the data, and the major variables used in the **run_analysis.R** script.

## Data:

The **run_analysis.R** script uses data which represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
Each record provides:
* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
* Its activity label.
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The source data for this project was downloaded from here:
<a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">UCI HAR Dataset </a>

The dataset includes the following files:
* **features_info.txt**: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
* **features.txt**: List of all features.
* **activity_labels.txt**: Links the class labels with their activity name.
* **train/X_train.txt**: Training set.
* **train/y_train.txt**: Training labels.
* **train/subject_train.txt**: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
* **train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt**: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.
* **train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt**: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
* **train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt**: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
* **test/X_test.txt**: Test set.
* **test/y_test.txt**: Test labels.
* **test/subject_train.txt**: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
* **test/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt**: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.
* **test/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt**: The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
* **test/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt**: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

## Transformations:

The **run_analysis.R** script performs the following transformations to clean up the data:
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Variables:

The following explains major variables used in the run_analysis.R script:
* **one_data_set**: This variable stores a data set that is merged from the training and test data set.
* **extracted_mean_and_std**: This variable stores a extracted data set of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement from the **one_data_set**.
* **second_tidy_data_set**: This variable stores a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from **extracted_mean_and_std**.
